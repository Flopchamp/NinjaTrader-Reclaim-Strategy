   - Points Above (Ticks): How many ticks price must move below the level
     * Default is 8 ticks (which equals 2 points on ES/MES)
     * For ES/MES: 4 ticks = 1 point, so 8 ticks = 2 points
   
   - Held Above Time (Seconds): How long price must stay above the level
     * Default is 270 seconds (which equals 4 minutes and 30 seconds)
     * To change: multiply minutes by 60 and add seconds
     * Example: 5 minutes = 300 seconds, 3 min 45 sec = 225 seconds
   
   - Stop Down (Ticks): Your stop loss in ticks
     * Default is 40 ticks (which equals 10 points on ES/MES)
     * Adjust based on your risk management

STEP 13: UNDERSTANDING THE INDICATOR SIGNALS
──────────────────────────────────────────────

The indicator will automatically display text signals as market conditions change:

SIGNAL 1: "CROSSED 2 pts BELOW"
  - This appears when price drops 2 points (or your set value) below a Major
    Support Level
  - This is the first condition being met
  - Color: White text with slate gray background
  - Location: Appears to the left of the current bar

SIGNAL 2: "RECLAIMED LEVEL"
  - This appears when price crosses back above the same Major Support Level
  - A timer starts counting from 0 seconds
  - The timer appears on the chart showing elapsed time (HH:MM:SS)
  - Color: White text with slate gray background
  - Location: Appears to the left of the current bar

SIGNAL 3: Timer Display
  - Shows "Timer: 00:00:00" format
  - Counts up in real-time while price stays above the level
  - If price drops back below the level, timer resets and disappears
  - Color: Yellow text with black background

SIGNAL 4: "ENTER THE TRADE"
  - This appears when price has held above the level for your set time
  - This is your entry signal to take the trade
  - The timer disappears when this signal shows

PART 5: CHANGING SETTINGS AFTER INSTALLATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 14: EDITING INDICATOR SETTINGS (Daily Updates)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each trading day, you'll need to update your price levels:

1. Right-click anywhere on the chart
2. Hover over "Indicators"
3. Find "ReclaimLevelsIndicator" in the list
4. Click on it to open the properties window
5. Update your daily values in each section
6. Click "OK" to apply the changes

QUICK TIP FOR DAILY UPDATES:
- Keep a notepad or spreadsheet with your daily values ready
- Update the indicator first thing each morning before market open
- Double-check all values before clicking OK

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 6: TROUBLESHOOTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM: The indicator doesn't appear on the chart
SOLUTION:
- Make sure compilation was successful (no errors in Step 6)
- Try closing and reopening the chart
- Try restarting NinjaTrader
- Re-compile the indicator (open NinjaScript Editor, find the indicator, click Compile)

PROBLEM: The lines appear but in wrong locations
SOLUTION:
- Right-click chart > Indicators > ReclaimLevelsIndicator
- Double-check all your price values
- Make sure you're entering prices, not ticks
- Verify you're on the correct instrument (ES or MES)

PROBLEM: No signals appear on the chart
SOLUTION:
- Make sure your chart is in "Calculate on bar close" mode
- Verify that price has actually met the conditions
- Check the Output window for any error messages:
  * Tools > Output Window (or press Ctrl+I)
- Make sure all Trading Parameters are set correctly

PROBLEM: Timer doesn't appear
SOLUTION:
- The timer only appears after price reclaims a level
- Make sure price has crossed below AND back above a Major Support
- Check that your time parameter is greater than 0

PROBLEM: Colors don't match the specifications
SOLUTION:
- The colors are hard-coded in the indicator
- If you want different colors, you would need to edit the code
- This would require changing values in the NinjaScript Editor

PART 7: TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. DAILY PREPARATION
   - Update your levels every morning before market open
   - Keep a trading journal with your daily levels for reference
   - Test on Playback first before using in live trading

2. CHART SETUP
   - Use a clean chart with minimal other indicators to avoid clutter
   - Zoom the chart to see several hours of price action
   - Make sure text is readable by adjusting chart zoom level

3. MONITORING THE INDICATOR
   - Watch for the "CROSSED 2 pts BELOW" signal first
   - Pay attention to the timer when it appears
   - Be ready to enter when "ENTER THE TRADE" appears

4. RISK MANAGEMENT
   - Always use the Stop Down parameter for your stop loss
   - Don't override the indicator's signals based on emotions
   - Keep position sizing consistent with your risk management plan

5. PRACTICE MODE
   - Use Simulation account or Market Replay to practice first
   - Get comfortable with how signals appear and timing
   - Verify the indicator works correctly with your data feed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 8: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT THE INDICATOR DOES:
This indicator helps you identify and trade "reclaim" setups on ES or MES futures.
It plots important support levels and automatically monitors when price:
1. Drops below a major support level by a specified amount
2. Crosses back above (reclaims) that level
3. Holds above that level for a specified time period
4. Generates an entry signal when conditions are met

UNDERSTANDING TICKS VS POINTS:
- ES and MES move in ticks (smallest price increments)
- ES: 1 tick = 0.25 points, so 4 ticks = 1 point
- MES: Same tick size as ES (0.25)
- The indicator uses TICKS for calculations, so:
  * 8 ticks = 2 points (default setting)
  * 40 ticks = 10 points (default stop)

CALCULATION MODE:
- The indicator uses "Calculate on Bar Close"
- This means signals appear when a bar closes, not during the bar
- This prevents false signals but creates a slight delay
- For more responsive signals, this can be changed in the code

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This indicator is designed specifically for ES and MES contracts
- It can be used on other instruments but tick values may differ
- Always test in Simulation or Playback before live trading
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
